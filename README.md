# minecraft-autofish
(Minecraft) automatically reels in and recasts a fishing rod when there's a bite

## How It Works
The only time the word "fishing" appears in the in-game subtitles is when the "fishing bobber slashes" - the program searches for an image of that word on the screen and sends two right-clicks with some delay to reel in and re-cast accordingly.
