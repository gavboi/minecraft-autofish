# minecraft-autofish
(Minecraft) automatically reels in and recasts a fishing rod when there's a bite

## How It Works
The only time the word "Fishing" appears in the in-game subtitles is when the "fishing bobber splashes" - the program searches for an image of "Fi" on the screen and sends two right-clicks with some delay to reel in and re-cast accordingly.

#### Files
The .ahk requires AutoHotKey to be installed to run it and needs the .bmp in the same directory. The .exe is a standalone executable compiled from the two others that acts identically.
